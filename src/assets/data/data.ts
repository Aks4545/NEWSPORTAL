  "head1":"इंदौर में खेले जा रहे तीसरे टेस्ट को जीतते ही ऑस्ट्रेलिया की टीम आईसीसी विश्व टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप के फाइनल में एंट्री कर जाएगी, वहीं टीम इंडिया की मुश्किलें बढ़ जाएंगी। ",
  "news":"ICC World Test Championship Final IND vs AUS : टीम इंडिया ऑस्ट्रेलिया के खिलाफ इंदौर में खेले जा रहे तीसरे टेस्ट में हार की कगार पर खड़ी है। भारतीय टीम हालांकि पहले दो मैच जीतकर सीरीज में अजेय बढ़त हासिल कर चुकी है, लेकिन टीम के लिए ये मैच काफी अहम है। भारतीय टीम को आईसीसी विश्व टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप के फाइनल में जाने के लिए कम से कम एक और मैच जीतने की जरूरत है। अब इंदौर टेस्ट जिस मोड़ पर खड़ा है, वहां से जीत तो लगभग नामुमकिन सी नजर आ रही है। लेकिन कहा जाता है ना कि क्रिकेट में कभी भी कुछ भी हो सकता है, तो अगर आपको उस पर भरोसा है तो उम्मीद की एक लौ जलाए रखिए। लेकिन हकीकत यही है कि टीम इंडिया के हाथ से ये मैच निकल चुका है। अगर भारतीय टीम इंदौर टेस्ट हारती है तो आईसीसी विश्व टेस्ट चैंपियनशिप यानी डब्ल्यूटीसी के फाइनल में जाने का रास्ता और भी कठिन हो जाएगा। वहीं अगर ऑस्ट्रेलिया की बात की जाए तो अगर ये मैच टीम जीत जाती है तो डब्ल्यूटीसी के फाइनल में जाने वाली कंगारू पहली टीम बन जाएगी। अब ये जरूरी हो गया है कि अगर इस मैच में हार मिलती है तो अहमदाबाद में होने वाला चौथा मैच भारतीय टीम को हर हाल में जीतना होगा। श्रीलंका की टीम के पास अंक तो 64 ही हैं, लेकिन जीत प्रतिशत 53.33 है। अगर श्रीलंका की टीम न्यूजीलैंड को उसी की जमीन पर दोनों मैच हरा देती है तो मामला और भी फंस जाएगा। वहीं एक समीकरण ये भी है कि इंदौर टेस्ट हारने के बाद आखिरी मैच जो अहमदाबाद में खेला जाएगा, वो टीम इंडिया ड्रॉ करा लेती है तो भी उसका फाइनल में जाना करीब करीब तय माना जा रहा है। लेकिन श्रीलंका को अपना मैच हारना होगा। लेकिन इस बीच इतना तो जरूर है कि टीम इंडिया की हार से इंतजार बढ़ गया है, लेकिन माना जाना चाहिए कि इंदौर मैच का नतीजा चाहे जो भी हो, लेकिन अगर अहमदाबाद में टीम इंडिया जीत या मैच ड्रॉ हुआ तो भी फाइनल में पहुंच जाएगी। खैर अभी तीसरे मैच के खत्म होने का इंतजार कीजिए और उसके बाद नौ मार्च को लेकर देखिए कि आखिरी मैच में टीम इंडिया किस रणनीति के साथ मैदान में उतरती है।",

They also met in the third round of the FA Cup — an initial match and then a replay.Wolverhampton remained three points above the relegation zone while Liverpool has won three of its last four league games amid a recovery from a slow start to the season.",

      "news":"Ishan Kishan had an extended session in the nets on March 7. Coach Rahul Dravid kept an eye on the young wicketkeeper-batter as he batted in different nets. When Ishan was honing his batting skills under watch of the Indian coach, KS Bharat was on the main square of the ground. He first underwent wicket-keeping drills and then had a little feel of the venue with a light batting session on the side strip.Kishan or Bharat? Batting intent or wicketkeeping skills?The management went ahead with the safer option in Bharat on turners which were presented for the first three Tests. Returns with the bat weren’t encouraging but the inexperienced stumper did a more than decent job with the gloves on. It’s not easy to keep on these strips with raging turn and variable bounce. With so much spin bowling in the series so far, the wicketkeepers have hardly got breathing space behind the stumps.With Ahmedabad expected to roll out a better surface than the first three Tests, there would have been a temptation within the Indian camp to beef up on the intent quotient in the middle-order. And on those lines, a lot of attention was paid on how the two wicketkeeper-batters went about their business on match eve. Bharat was first to enter the practice area and had KL Rahul for company in the adjacent net. Soon, Kishan joined the training squad in the area and had a hit. Not many playing XI cues to pick from how the events unfolded but India captain Rohit Sharma gave some clarity after coach Dravid dead batted the matter.The Indian team had faced a similar situation some time back when Wriddhiman Saha was the preferred choice at home, for his glove work on turners, and Rishabh Pant’s batting helped him get the nod on overseas assignments. Pant’s improvement with the gloves and more domination with the bat helped him become the automatic choice both home and away, and now his absence posed a headache in Tests.",

To facilitate this, Foxconn plans to invest $200 million in building a new factory in Telangana.  Reuters reports that Foxconn has won an order from Apple—that will let it manufacture AirPods—for the first time ever, and marks the gradual shift from dependance on China.   A source has confirmed to Reuters that Foxconn will be investing over $200 million in their new AirPod plant in Telangana, India. However, the exact value of the AirPods order remains unclear. The source also revealed that Foxconn officials had deliberated for several months on whether to manufacture AirPods due to lower profit margins, but ultimately decided to proceed with the deal as a means of strengthening their partnership with Appl    “That way, we are more likely to get orders for their new products,” Reuters’ source said.Apple has chosen India as the manufacturing location, possibly to diversify production and reduce reliance on China amidst the recent COVID outbreaks and geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington. The construction of the manufacturing facility in Telangana is set to begin in the second half of this year, with AirPods production beginning no earlier than the end of 2024, according to the source.  It is unclear how Foxconn’s production plan will affect current AirPod suppliers, including Luxshare Precision Industry and Goertek Inc, who have not responded to the matter. Earlier this year, reports emerged that Foxconn is considering producing iPhone parts on a 300-acre site near Bengaluru, Karnataka. This move could potentially create up to 1,00,000 jobs in India and mark a shift in the electronic components manufacturing hub away from China.",

The phone’s flat edges and curved corners make it easy to use with one hand, and the glossy finish adds extra charm. The only downside is the placement of the Poco text next to the camera module.

      "news":"Xiaomi is ready to unleash the vanilla Redmi Note 12 series later this month. The company is hosting a global event to launch the new Redmi Note 12 phones that will sit below the Redmi Note Pro lineup in the company’s portfolio.     The Redmi Note series has been popular for the company over the years, notching up millions in sales across multiple countries, including India. Redmi Note has been synonymous with value-for-money for the buyer but with the changing price landscape of phones in 2023, expect the Redmi Note 12 series also to cost higher than usual but with new features in tow.        REDMI NOTE 12 SERIES LAUNCH DATE DETAILS-The Redmi Note 12 series is going to launch on March 23 and for those watching in India the event starts at 8:30 PM on Thursday. The teaser of the invite from Xiaomi suggests the phones will have a vivid display, which could be the AMOLED display and probably offer a new set of cameras.Xiaomi has recently started focusing on the global markets with its products. The Xiaomi 13 Pro with the Leica cameras made its global debut at the Mobile World Congress 2023 (MWC 2023) in Barcelona last month. Having a global launch for the Redmi Note 12 series hints at more countries getting the devices. REDMI NOTE 12 SERIES LAUNCH: WHAT TO EXPECT- Redmi Note 12 is likely to be powered by MediaTek Dimensity chipset, while other variants could offer the Snapdragon 7 series chip. You could be looking at 108MP cameras on the vanilla model this time, which shouldn’t be surprising considering the Pro Plus model has a 200MP shooter. We expect Xiaomi to have MIUI 14 on these devices now that it has been officially released. The battery charging speed could stick with 67W which is not bad for the segment.The Redmi Note 12 Pro models have got a starting price of Rs 18,000 this year, which means the Redmi Note 12 could be around Ra 15,000 unless Xiaomi decides to have a under Rs 13,000 variant for the buyers.",

According to Pakistan-based news outlet GeoTV, additional sessions judge Faizan Haider Gillani heard the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief’s petition.   The arrest warrant was issued against Khan because he repeatedly failed to appear before the court following which a police party flew to Lahore aboard a special helicopter to arrest him.The judge also directed Khan’s lawyers to fix relevant documents in the case and present it to the court once more since he was struggling to understand the documents which were submitted. Imran Khan’s lawyers also argued that the government withdrew his security as a reason for him not appearing before the court. The judge asked the legal team to present the letter which states that Khan’s security has been withdrawn.  When Imran Khan’s lawyers argued that Imran Khan appeared in the judicial complex, the judge pointed out that he did not appear before the court.   The government prosecutor argued that the former prime minister was also summoned in the Toshakhana Reference case.  The judge said Khan can appear before the court and take the copies of the case.  The hearing was then adjourned till March 16. Meanwhile, since Tuesday evening, PTI workers have clashed with security forces as they reached Lahore’s Zaman Park to arrest Imran Khan in the Toshakhana reference case.Imran Khan said that the Pakistan government is planning to abduct and assassinate him.",

Khan was ousted from office by a no-confidence vote last year, and has been snarled in a series of legal cases as he campaigns for early elections and a return to office.   Police fought pitched battles with supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party near his Zaman Park residence throughout the night, firing fusillades of teargas and dodging rocks thrown by angry crowds. Khan issued a video shortly before dawn, sitting in front of Pakistan and PTI flags at a desk decorated with spent teargas canisters. “I am telling the entire nation today that they are ready once again, they’re going to come again. They will teargas our people and do other such things, but you should know that they have no justification to do so.It is the second time in recent weeks that police have been sent from the capital Islamabad to Khan’s home in the eastern city of Lahore to serve an arrest warrant after he skipped several court dates linked to a corruption case citing security concerns. “We are here basically to execute the warrants and to arrest him, Syed Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari, deputy inspector general of Islamabad police, told reporters Tuesday outside Khan’s residence.

This recommendation was made by Ajay Jain Bhutoria, who is a member of the President’s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI). “The immigration subcommittee recommends the Department of Homeland Security and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to extend the grace period for H1-B workers, who have lost their jobs, from 60 days to 180 days,” Ajay Bhutoria, said on Tuesday during the meeting of the commission on AANHPI.As a result, many H1-B workers are forced to leave the country which could result in a loss of skilled labour for the United States, he told members of the advisory commission.  Bhutoria, during the panel meeting, strongly advocated for the extension of the grace period, citing the need to support highly skilled tech employees who he said are essential to the economic growth of the United States. The extension would also provide affected employees with more time to navigate the complex and time-consuming process of finding new employment opportunities and transferring their H1-B status, he said. Members of the commission, recognising the importance of supporting and retaining highly skilled tech employees, supported the move. Bhutoria’s recommendation to extend the grace period for H1-B workers is a critical step towards ensuring that highly skilled tech employees can continue to contribute to the economic growth of the United States without fear of losing their status.",

Russia is a main backer of Assad and has a broad presence in Syria, where a 12-year uprising-turned-civil war has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country’s pre-war population. Moscow has played a pivotal role in fighting back armed opposition groups trying to topple Assad’s government through its military support, and has also aggressively backed Damascus against opponents at the United Nations.   The Kremlin confirmed Tuesday that Putin will meet with Assad on Wednesday — the anniversary of the conflict — in a statement carried by Russia’s state news agency Tass. According to the statement, “further development of Russian-Syrian cooperation in the political, trade, economic and humanitarian spheres, as well as the prospects for a comprehensive settlement of the situation in and around Syria,” will be on the agenda.Assad was received by Putin’s special representative for the Middle East, Mikhail Bogdanov, at Moscow’s Vnukovo international airport.

        "news":"The US military said a Russian fighter plane clipped the propeller of one its spy drones and made it crash into the Black Sea on Tuesday in the first such direct encounter between the two world powers since Russia invaded Ukraine over a year ago. The Russian defence ministry offered a different account and Moscow’s ambassador to Washington said his country ”views this incident as a provocation” involving a U.S. MQ-9 drone and Russian Su-27 fighter jet   The United States, which has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, has not become directly engaged in the war but it does conduct regular surveillance flights in the region   Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Voldoymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday night that military commanders were unanimously in favour of defending the eastern frontline, including the ruined city of Bakhmut, which has been under siege by Russia for months.”The main focus was on … Bakhmut,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. ”There was a clear position of the entire command: Strengthen this sector and destroy the occupiers to the maximum. Zelenskiy dismissed three regional governors, including Luhansk in the east, Odesa on the Black Sea in the south and Khnelnitskiy region in the west, but no reason was given in the announcement by the government’s parliamentary representative.  On the diplomatic and economic fronts, talks continued to extend a deal to allow grain shipments from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports that is due to expire this week, the United Nations and Turkey said. The Kyiv government rejected a Russian push for a 60-day renewal, half the term of the previous renewal  DRONE CRASH:Two Russian Su-27 jets carried out what the U.S. military described as a reckless intercept of the American spy drone while flying in international air space. It said the Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on the MQ-9 – possibly trying to blind or damage it – and flew in front of it in unsafe manoeuvres.After around 30 to 40 minutes, at 7:03 a.m. (0603 GMT), one of the jets then collided with the drone, causing it to crash, the U.S. military said.Russia has not recovered the drone and the jet was likely damaged, the Pentagon said.”In fact, this unsafe and unprofessional act by the Russians nearly caused both aircraft to crash,” U.S. Air Force General James Hecker, who oversees the U.S. Air Force in the region, said in a statement.Russia’s defence ministry denied that its aircraft had come into contact with the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which it said had crashed after ”sharp manoeuvring”. It said the drone had been detected near the Crimea peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.”The Russian fighters did not use their onboard weapons, did not come into contact with the UAV and returned safely to their home airfield,” the defence ministry said.The accounts of the incident in the Black Sea, which is bordered by Russia and Ukraine among other countries, could not be independently verified.RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SUMMONEDussia’s Ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov was summoned by the U.S. State Department to discuss what happened over the Black Sea, said spokesperson Ned Price.Antonov said his meeting was ”constructive” and the issue of possible ”consequences” for Moscow was not raised, RIA state news agency reported.”As for us, we do not want any confrontation between the United States and Russia. We are in favour of building pragmatic relations for the benefit of the Russian and American peoples,” Antonov was quoted as saying.Russian President Vladimir Putin has framed Moscow’s ”special military operation” in Ukraine as a defensive one against what he sees as a hostile West bent on expanding into territories historically ruled by Russia.Ukraine and its Western allies say Moscow is waging an unprovoked war of conquest that has destroyed Ukrainian cities, killed thousands of people and forced millions more to flee their homes.",

He reportedly has no one to take care of him.  As stated in the reports, Durai’s film Pithamagan was a blockbuster at the box office and bagged a National Award too. Overwhelmed with the enthusiastic response to his film, Durai reportedly paid Rs 25 lakh in 2003 to Pithamagan’s director Bala. Durai wanted Bala to be the one to direct his next production venture too. In an unfortunate turn of events, the film didn’t materialise. Shockingly, Bala reportedly didn’t return the payment to Durai. Durai had to fight a legal battle with Bala for 19 years to get his Rs 25 lakh back. He even protested outside Bala’s office. Sadly, even after spending a significant part of his life in this battle, he achieved nothing.Durai’s fans feel that this long-waged battle must have taken a toll on his health and rendered him helpless, physically and financially.",

    "news":"Washington, Mar 15 (PTI) The United States recognises the McMahon Line as the international boundary between China and Arunachal Pradesh, according to a bipartisan Senate resolution which sees Arunachal Pradesh as an integral part of India.At a time when China continues to pose grave and gathering threats to the Free and Open Indo-Pacific, it is critical for the United States to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our strategic partners in the region, especially India,” Senator Bill Hagerty, who along with Senator Jeff Merkley introduced a resolution in the Senate, said.“This bipartisan resolution expresses the Senate’s support for unequivocally recognising the state of Arunachal Pradesh as an integral part of India, condemning China’s military aggression to change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control, and further enhancing the US-India strategic partnership and the Quad in support of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” he said on Tuesday.",
    "news1":"The resolution, which comes following the biggest clash between the Republic of India and China in the Eastern Sector along the Line of Actual Control in six years, reaffirms that the United States recognises the McMahon Line as the international boundary between China and the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.The bipartisan Senators’ resolution condemns additional China’s provocations, including the People’s Republic of China’s use of military force to change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control, construction of villages in contested areas, publication of maps with Mandarin-language names for cities and features in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, and expansion of PRC territorial claims in Bhutan. The resolution also pushes back against People’s Republic of China (PRC) claims that Arunachal Pradesh is PRC territory, which is a part of the PRC’s increasingly aggressive and expansionist policies. “America’s values supporting freedom and a rules-based order must be at the center of all of our actions and relationships around the world, especially as the PRC government pushes an alternative vision,” Merkley said.",
     "news2":" Furthermore, the resolution commends the Government of India for taking steps to defend itself against aggression and security threats from the People’s Republic of China. These efforts include securing India’s telecommunications infrastructure; examining its procurement processes and supply chains; implementing investment screening standards; and expanding its cooperation with Taiwan in public health and other sectors. The resolution serves to further strengthen the US-India bilateral partnership regarding defense, technology, economics, and people-to-people ties and promotes enhancing our multilateral cooperation with India through the Quad, the East Asia Summit alongside our partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and other international fora.",

    "news":"Russia’s largest rolling stock maker Transmashholding (TMH) has emerged as the lowest bidder for the tender to manufacture 200 Vande Bharat trainsets in India.TMH’s company Metrowagonmash based in Russia’s Mytishchi, in partnership with Railway PSU Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), has quoted ₹120 crore per trainset — the lowest by a long margin, at a time when New Delhi is under pressure to reduce its trade ties with Moscow.  Indian engineering major Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) and Kolkata-based Titagarh Wagons tie-up has emerged as the second lowest bidder quoting Rs 139.8 crore per trainset.  The tender, the biggest Vande Bharat induction call in one go by India so far, seeks to bring in sleeper versions of the marquee train, along with the current seating-only types.Among other three bidders, BEML in partnership with German major Siemens quoted the third lowest rate at Rs 145 crore per trainset.French rolling stock maker Alstom stood at the fourth spot while Swiss company Stadler in partnership with Hyderabad-based Medha, suppliers of the propulsion system of the current Vande Bharat, has quoted the fifth lowest rate.The offer is to manufacture the trainsets in India and deliver them in a phased manner in about 2-5 years while also looking after the maintenance of the trainsets for 35 years. The trainsets will be manufactured in the railway factories in India like Latur in Maharashtra, Sonepat in Haryana, and ICF Chennai.This is TMH’s first foray into getting a piece of the Railway business pie in India. Railway Board sources said the plan is to divide the order into first two lowest bidders in a 60-40 ratio. While the lowest bidder will get to make 120 trainsets, the second-lowest bidder, if it agrees to match the lowest bid, would get an order of the remaining 80.While the TMH-RVNL combine has quoted the rate for 200 trainsets, the BHEL-Titagarh group quoted for 120 trainsets. “As per rules, we will ask the second lowest bidder to match the rate of the lowest bidder and manufacture 80 sets,” said a senior Railways ministry official.If BHEL refuses, the offer to match the lowest bid will be made to the rest and if none of them agrees to match the rate then the TMH-RVNL will get to manufacture all 200 sets, sources said. “The tender condition says the maker can bring its own design or replicate the existing design,” said another official.Transmashholding, TMH, Railway PSU Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Russia, moscow, Indian Express, India news, current affairsThe offer is to manufacture the trainsets in India and deliver them in a phased manner in about 2-5 years while also looking after the maintenance of the trainsets for 35 years.

They have no footprint in India and it will not be an easy task for them to deliver in time. It surely is a dampener for competent manufacturers like Alstom, Siemens and Stadler and some uncertainty for this ambitious project,” he added. ",

French rolling stock major Alstom and Swiss makers Stadler with India’s Medha — the two players who have bid for the aluminium trainsets — have jumped into the fray for the 200 trainset deal. Along with them are consortia of Indian makers BEML and German multinational Siemens; BHEL and Kolkata-based Titagarh Wagons; and Russia’s largest rolling stock maker Transmashholding (TMH) with railway PSU RVNL joining the list to bid for the tender. They had all submitted the tender in November last year.Vande Bharat Bengaluru The government in the 2022 budget had set a target of rolling out 400 Vande Bharat trainsets over the next three years. (File)The Vande Bharat project got a boost this week with significant progress in the two mega tenders to produce the semi-high-speed trainsets.Five players are slated to qualify for making 200 trainsets on Wednesday, in a tender floated a few months ago, merely a week after two mega players put in their technical bids for 100 aluminium Vande Bharats — a first in India. French rolling stock major Alstom and Swiss makers Stadler with India’s Medha — the two players who have bid for the aluminium trainsets — have jumped into the fray for the 200 trainset deal.The technical qualification round may be opened on Wednesday, enabling the players to participate in the financial bids round that will follow next to decide the final winners.Eventually, the deal to manufacture and maintain may be split between the lowest and the second-lowest bidders, wherein the one quoting the lowest price will get to manufacture 60 per cent and the second-lowest bidder will make the rest. Sources said a part of the deal would also include sleeper versions. The deal consists of a maintenance contract for 35 years and the upgradation of maintenance depots.The government in the 2022 budget had set a target of rolling out 400 Vande Bharat trainsets over the next three years.While these 200 trainsets will be made of steel, the other 100 will be made of aluminium, something India has always shied away from because it is typically more expensive, and the country still needs to get the coach-making technology for it. Railways has decided to change that. Globally, aluminium trainsets for high-speed projects are common. Sources said that if made with aluminium, the Vande Bharats may cost around Rs 130 crore per trainset. Railways wants these trains to be unmatched in terms of reduced noise levels and better stability as felt by passengers riding them, besides being safe. However, engineers say the overall gain comes from saving energy and better speed, translating into higher earning potential.Each aluminium trainset is around 50 tons lighter in weight, consuming much less energy than its counterparts made of steel. About the higher cost, officials said that by factoring in inflation and other associated costs of the current steel-made Vande Bharat trainsets, the aluminium ones come out to be marginally higher, whereas the money saved by way of less energy consumed and faster turnaround for each trainset, is much higher, translating into a higher revenue potential in operations.",
